# Hello-World
###Our Joint Research Unitâ€™s main goal is to understand the role of epigenetic mechanisms governing cellular fate, with a particular emphasis on the maintenance of pluripotency, neuronal and muscular differentiation, misregulations of epigenetic mechanisms in cancers, neurodevelopmental diseases and stress responses

###Our teams investigate the impact of DNA methylation, histone modifications translation control  and non-coding RNA machineries on physiological processes and diseases. Our projects leads us to actively produce and analyse high throughput datasets. Many teams are also involved in collaborations with physicists and study the effects of mechanical constraints and how the epigenome is contributing to mechano-transduction.
